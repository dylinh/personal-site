            <hr/>
            <p>In May, I decided to deactivate all my social media accounts and eventually permanently delete them. In this blog post, I will discuss my general thoughts on social media, my motivations, and the changes that have occurred in my life as a result. I first want to talk about the three questions I asked myself:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>What do I actually want to spend my time on everyday and am I spending enough time on those things?</li>
            <li>In 10 years, am I going to regret using my phone this much?</li>
            <li>What value am I actually getting out of these platforms? </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Simply put, I was spending too much time on the platforms and wasn't where I wanted to be in life. Some days I would be spending an hour on my phone, others more than four. Staying disciplined with my time on social media was an extremely difficult endeavour for good reason; companies spend millions of dollars on research to maximize user engagement. It’s the reason why I think trying to balance social media is a losing battle.<br/><br/></p>
        <p><span className="bold">Screen time</span><br/>Being on my phone for less than thirty minutes per day has allowed me to spend more time with my family, work towards my career goals, and be more curious about things I would’ve thought about. I was able to put in ~4-5 hours a day learning front end development over the summer while taking a full-time course load, working 20 hours a week, and staying healthy. I’ve also become more intentional with my phone pickups which has reduced screen time.<br/><br/></p>
        <p><span className="bold">Focus</span><br/>My attention span has improved and so has my ability to stay present. This has benefitted my conversations, thereby my relationships. I’m able to program for much longer without getting distracted and be more productive. I still go through a rut sometimes but I've been able to recover more quickly back into a focused and productive state. Deleting social media was one of the many building blocks to improve my focus, but these things have also helped: only consuming long duration content such as books/podcasts, using a physical calendar & journal, and other measures to reduce the amount of times I need to pick up my phone. For example, I noticed I'd constantly pull out my phone to check the time so I bought a watch.<br/><br/></p>
        <p><span className="bold">Noise</span><br/>I believe social media massively influences your subconscious. It’s a low friction dopamine source that overwhelms you with (mostly) garbage information. Whenever you feel slightly uncomfortable or bored, it’s so easy to scroll. I noticed that the more time I’d spend on my phone, the more I’d compare myself to others and wonder what people thought about me. I’d also tend to care about how I'm portraying myself online. <br/><br/>As a twenty-year-old, these are things I no longer want to think about. Over the past one hundred days, my thought quality has improved and the detrimental thoughts have started to fade away. I feel like I've been more creative, I reflect more deeply on past conversations, and form deeper connections.<br/><br/></p>
        <p><span className="bold">Tradeoffs</span><br/>With every decision you make, there are tradeoffs. Without a doubt, social media is an amazing way to initiate new connections and strengthen existing ones. Limiting myself to text is limiting myself to potential friendships. To compensate, I’ve started to be more proactive with my social life by being active in clubs and my fraternity, seeking social opportunities, and initiating conversations with strangers.<br/><br/>Not having social media is pretty abnormal. It can be awkward when somebody asks me for my Instagram and I offer them my number instead. People will think about you differently, good and bad. I’ve found it interesting to see how people’s opinions of me have changed. Ultimately I’m confident in my decision and I think it’s been a net positive on my life. <br/><br/><span className="bold">Conclusion</span><br/>I’d say that’s been the gist of my past one hundred days without social media. I’m going to continue to stay off the applications until I have a compelling reason to do so. I’m leaning towards getting a Light Phone once my iPhone dies out, but that’s probably overkill.
